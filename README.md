# react

```
whenever you add paranthesis to a function you are invoking it or running it straight through way
```

```
React is like a library
library - packed together of JS code that allows to use something in an easier way.

JS Package : GSAP write animations in much easier fashion compared to css and vanilla JS and it allows to do much complex things like easyings and chaining together multiple animations 


React helps to reload only specific parts of the page dynamically keeping every other parts constant
```

```
React does few weird things when compared to vanilla JS and HTML

ServiceWorker : it works outside the dom and it allows you to 
1. sync in the background
2. push notifications in the background
3. whenever you don't have an internet activated it still allows to cache the webpage or your website or app and still you use it offline


it gives an ability to work like an app on your phone

so there are several apps now or websites these days that have these ServiceWorkers and they can work like an app
so you can pretty much drag it on your phone and you can open it without any connection and they still can work in the same way so gives you a kind of functionality that the browser does not allow you to do.

```
In react you can write classes in JS
```


```
1. className
2. for
3. htmlfor
```

```
deleting files for now

logo.svg
app.css
index.css
setupTests
```

```
In App.js you can see className= box
```

```
In react you can write classes along with functions
```
